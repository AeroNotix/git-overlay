Creates a simple overlay for the current buffer that shows non-staged git chunks.

Lines around additions/deletions are shown blue, additions in green, deletetions
won't show up at all.

Just copy it somewhere in your load-path, or add the directory containing the
git-overlay.el file with (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/repo/")

then just (require 'git-overlay) and do M-x git-overlay in a buffer with a file
from a git repository open.
